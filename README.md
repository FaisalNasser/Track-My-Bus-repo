# Track-My-Bus-repo
Our project aims to take advantage of the resources available to serve the citizen directly, as we note that public transportation buses are often random traffic for the citizen (the customer), that is, he does not know if the bus designated for a particular transport line is close to it, and how long does the bus need to reach near From it, if this matter is resolved, most of the citizens ’problems will be solved, especially the problem of long waiting or delay from work who take buses daily, not to mention the benefit that students will receive, for example, leaving the house at a certain time commensurate with the appropriate time for the bus to reach the closest position to the student’s home Within a certain transmission line, so there is no time wasted if the bus misses.
